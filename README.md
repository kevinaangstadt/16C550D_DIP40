# 16C550D LQFP-48 to DIP-40 Adapter

Modern TI 16C550D UARTs are only available in surface mount packages; however,
this is a pain if you are trying to build something on a breadboard. This board
provides a breakout to the traditional DIP-40 layout of the 16550.

# Fabrication
These boards can be purchased from OSHPark
[here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/E7OcseDq). The "After Dark" service
provides the coolest looking result.
